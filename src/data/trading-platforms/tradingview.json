  "description": "Born in 2011 from the minds of Stan Bokov, Denis Globa, and Constantin Ivanov (creators of professional platform MultiCharts), TradingView solved a radical problem: democratizing institutional-grade analysis. Their \"Look First, Then Leap\" philosophy wasn't just branding—it encoded a methodological shift from impulsive trading to data-driven decisions.",

    "pricingDetails": "Unlike legacy platforms charging $1,500/month, TradingView adopted a freemium model—a gamble that fueled its viral growth among forex retail traders. Nonetheless, TradingView’s tiered pricing model sparks debate among forex traders. Casual traders thrive on Essential, but Premium pays for itself via backtesting alone. Save 16% with annual billing."
