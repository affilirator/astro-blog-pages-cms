  "bottomline": "The FSCA isn’t perfect—its lack of a compensation fund and slow ODP rollout are real concerns. Yet it’s transformed South Africa into Africa’s most structured forex hub, where traders can access global markets with enforceable rights. As algorithmic trading and crypto CFDs explode, expect tighter FSCA scrutiny on price manipulation and AI ethics.",
